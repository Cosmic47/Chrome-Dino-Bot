# Chrome-Dino-Bot

literally just that. the bot is not ideal and can sometimes fail at the beginning of the game due to some weird cacti placement but uhhhhh, its pretty good, you can reach 30k and over with it. also the code is very readable, im not a dick that is going to obfuscate it for no reason unless legal issues or whatever.

to use the bot, open chrome devtools, paste the code, run it, close devtools and start the game.

your inputs are not omitted, so pressing the jump key will make dino jump anyways, so be careful when you're going to pretend to be chrome dino king/queen in front of your friends.
